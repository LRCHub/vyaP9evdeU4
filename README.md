[00:38.75] Oh, babe, I need that kind of love
[00:42.46] A supernova glowin' in the dark
[00:46.56] Forever, I wished upon a star
[00:50.46] Then you came over, occupied my heart, occupied my heart
[01:18.46] 
[00:56.17] Touch my body, skin on skin
[00:59.63] Gimme every little bit of your love (love)
[01:03.70] Don't you hold back on me, go all in
[01:07.54] I've been waiting for this moment too long (long)
[01:32.04] 
[01:12.45] One taste and I'm fallin' deep, caught up in your energy
[01:16.24] Never let me go
[01:23.74] 
[01:18.68] Oh, babe, I need that kind of love
[01:22.34] A supernova glowin' in the dark
[01:26.53] Forever, I wished upon a star (star)
[01:30.35] Then you came over, occupied my heart, occupied my heart
[01:58.35] 
[01:34.60] Dee-la-dee-la, da-dee-da-dee-da
[01:38.48] La-dee-la-dee-la, la-dee-la-dee-la
[01:42.67] Dee-la-dee-da, la-dee-la-dee-la
[01:46.42] Da-dee-da-dee-da, la-dee-la-dee-la (la-dee-la-dee-da)
[02:12.92] 
[01:50.53] (Oh, babe) got me how you want me, lose or win
[01:55.62] Giving every little bit of my trust
[01:59.61] Take me to the stars on paper wings
[02:03.70] And we'll fly until we reach the sun (ooh)
[02:24.70] 
[02:08.31] One kiss and I'm in a dream (dream), I'm lost in your melody (melody)
[02:12.63] Oh, it feels like heaven when you take it slow
[02:16.37] One taste and I'm fallin' deep (deep), caught up in your energy (energy)
[02:20.06] Never let me go
[02:27.56] 
[02:22.63] Oh, babe, I need that kind of love
[02:26.33] A supernova glowin' in the dark
[02:30.59] Forever, I wished upon a star (star)
[02:34.50] Then you came over, occupied my heart, occupied my heart
[03:02.50] 
[02:40.40] Every time I look in your eyes
[02:42.24] I see a million stars collide
[02:44.37] It's only you that I see in the sky
[02:45.86] When I pray to the heavens at night, you the light
[03:10.86] 
[02:48.10] Supernova love, never give it up in your heart
[02:50.12] Give me that love, give me that heart, yeah
[02:52.38] Through the dark, you the light, you the love
[02:54.18] You're the super, super, supernova love
[03:13.68] 
[02:55.16] Give me your love, give me the stars
[02:59.13] Baby, come on, occupy my heart
[03:03.13] Give your love, give me the stars
[03:07.25] Baby, come on, occupy my heart
[03:22.25] 
[03:10.58] Oh, babe, I need that kind of love (I need that kind of love)
[03:14.36] A supernova glowin' in the dark
[03:18.60] Forever, I wished upon a star (oh, star)
